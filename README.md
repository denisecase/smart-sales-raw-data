# smart-sales-raw-data

This repo provides **raw data** for the Smart Sales project.

These CSV files represent the **original, messy, real-world data** typically received from point-of-sale systems or other information sources, before any cleaning, transformation, or analysis.

## Instructions

1. Open your smart sales repository in VS Code. 
2. Run `git pull` to ensure you have the most currect work from GitHub. 
3. Create a folder named `data`, and in that data folder, create another folder named `raw`. 
4. Save each .csv (comma separated value) file to the `data/raw` folder of your smart sales repository.
